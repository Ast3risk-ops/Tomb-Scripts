# Tomb Scripts
 Some scripts to help linux users dig tombs

 # What is a tomb on linux?
 A tomb on linux is a LUKS encrypted space on your hard disk where you can put files. 
 It is protected by a password and you can hide the key in an image.

 # Installation

 ## Prerequisites
 
 ### Debian/Ubuntu

 ```bash
 sudo apt install tomb
 ```
 ## Run the scripts
 click the big green "Code" button, then, click "Download ZIP."
 Once that is done, run:
 ```bash
 cd path/to/directory
 ```
 replacing "path/to/directory" with the path to where the files are.

 then:
 ```bash
 ./digTomb.sh
 ```
 to dig your first tomb.
